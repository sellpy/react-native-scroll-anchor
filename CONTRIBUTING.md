# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small!

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development workflow

It contains the following packages:

- The library package in the root directory.
- An example app in the `example/` directory.

To get started with the project, run `npm install` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
npm install
```

The [example app](/example/) demonstrates usage of the library. You need to run it to test any changes you make.

It is configured to use the local version of the library, so any changes you make to the library's source code will be reflected in the example app. Changes to the library's JavaScript code will be reflected in the example app without a rebuild, but native code changes will require a rebuild of the example app.

You can use various commands from the root directory to work with the project.

To start the packager:

```sh
npm run example start
```

To run the example app on Android:

```sh
npm run example android
```

To run the example app on iOS:

```sh
npm run example ios
```

To run the example app on Web:

```sh
npm run example web
```

Make sure your code passes TypeScript and ESLint. Run the following to verify:

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

To fix formatting errors, run the following:

```sh
npm run lint --fix
```

Remember to add tests for your change if possible. Run the unit tests by:

```sh
npm run test
```

### Linting and tests

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting the code, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter and tests pass when committing.

### Scripts

The `package.json` file contains various scripts for common tasks:

- `npm install`: setup project by installing dependencies.
- `npm run typecheck`: type-check files with TypeScript.
- `npm run lint`: lint files with ESLint.
- `npm run test`: run unit tests with Jest.
- `npm run example start`: start the Metro server for the example app.
- `npm run example android`: run the example app on Android.
- `npm run example ios`: run the example app on iOS.

### Sending a pull request

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters and tests are passing.
- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
